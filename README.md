<h1>Anxiety Prevalence In The World</h1>
<h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
<p>In today’s society, mental health is a newer concept that we are all learning to be cognizant and understanding of. 
Everyone gets stressed in some form or fashion, and for some, this turns into anxiety which can affect one’s daily life. 
This issue especially hits close to home for our group’s demographic: 18-22 year old college students and personally for some of our group members. 
Because college can be stressful and overwhelming, this impacts our ability to perform at our best, 
and hopefully this project will shed some light on what we can do about it or at least understand how anxiety impacts us.</p>

<p>In researching and analyzing the prevalence of how anxiety affects the world and different countries and which factors show more likelihood to have anxiety, 
we hope to understand why anxiety is the issue that it is and if there are ways to combat it. 
Indisputably, the impact of too much stress and anxiety can negatively affect people’s health, 
so understanding causes and relationships as to why we suffer from anxiety may help society in the long run.</p>

<p>Because anxiety is only a portion of mental illnesses, the research findings we discover through this project will not be deterministic of other mental illnesses,
but it can become a conduit to train models for other mental illnesses. Depression, schizophrenia, drug addiction and many others are linked to anxiety, 
which is why understanding one area may lead to a better understanding of how other illnesses impact a person’s well-being. 
This is valuable because it can be a way to better understand how the world is impacted by mental health-- something that impacts everyone on a daily basis. 
As we test different factors such as gender, location, and year, we hope to illustrate how these factors determine anxiety or what groups of people suffer the most from anxiety, 
and what these implications mean for people around the world.</p>
